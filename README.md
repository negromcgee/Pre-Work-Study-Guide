# Study Guide Webpage
## A guide to help a new developer as they begin their journey


My motivation for this study guide was to create a reference for myself and other boot camp students who are going through the Prework in case we forget any information during coding bootcamp. This project will be a huge help after bootcamp and will always be here to look back at it for details on various topics. Also, it'll look great in my portfolio!
It contains notes on JavaScript, CSS, Git, and how to create an HTML.
